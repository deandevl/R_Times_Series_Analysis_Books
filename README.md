## Books/Articles on Time Series Analysis - Scripts, Notes, Plots

Repository contains completed scripts, plots, and notes from various books and articles in doing time series analysis in R. All of the work is presented in the form of R Markdown and the resulting html files.  The R scripts  rely heavily on R packages [RplotterPkg](https://github.com/deandevl/RplotterPkg) and [RtsaPkg](https://github.com/deandevl/RtsaPkg). The work was inspired by the following books/articles/courses/R packages:
